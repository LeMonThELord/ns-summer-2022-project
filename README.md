### Background information
As the society has become more and more competitive, wheather between students fighting for a better school, or between colleges for a better job and oppertunity.

Examples around us are too many for a pair of hands to count. A design that could help the Alzheimers patient come in mind with combination technology of Augmented reality device. As we as a group dig deeper about this topic and how to make it happen, we discovered that it can also come with extensions to not just help the patients but also normal people that need this kind of memory service.
